# Presentations
## Goal
As recommended by a communitymember it might be a great idea to hold small presentations frequently.
This might draw more experienced developers into our guild.
Based on [this idea](https://www.fluentcpp.com/dailycpp/).
This is not limited to just experienced people, anyone can get the chance to hold a presentation in front of interested people.
You can also take this as a chance to learn new stuff just to present it.

## Rules for presentations
- A presentation should last about 15 minutes.
- It has to be streamed to the server in some way.
- Topics should resolve around Computer Science, but mostly Java.
  It can be about almost anything: a cool Java feature, some cool SW-Pattern, a project you currently work on, ...
  The list goes on. Just pick a topic that you find interesting.
- Slides, example code, ... has to be uploaded afterwards to this repo via PR.
- A series of presentations is also allowed as long as each presentation does not "end with a cliffhanger"

## If you want to hold a presentation
- Message a moderator with a rough idea on what you want to talk about.
- Moderators will try to find a fitting timeslot for you and will announce it beforehand.
